# GopherCon Evening Debug Workshop

Welcome to the Advanced Go Debugging workshop!

## Workshop Requirements

* Go toolchain
* Delve
* Git
* Docker
* Vagrant

## Introduction

This course is aimed at more experienced developers who already know they're way around
a debugger. We will dive straight into advanced uses of Delve, Record and Replay debugging,
and how to debug programs running in different environments, such as remote debugging and
debugging within a container.

Aside from the specifics of using Delve I will also be teaching the "debugging mindset". The way
an engineer approaches the task of debugging their software is just as important, if not more important,
than the tools they use.
