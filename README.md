# GopherCon Morning Debug Workshop

Welcome to the Introduction to Debugging Go Programs workshop!

## Workshop Requirements

* Go toolchain
* Delve
* Git

## Introduction

This course will teach you the basics of using the Delve debugging in order to debug your
Go programs. Attendees will go from minimal to no knowledge of how to use a debugger to
being able to successfully use to tool to perform root cause analysis for bugs in Go programs.

Aside from teaching the basics of Delve, I will be teaching the "debugging mindset". An engineers
approach to solving a problem is as import, if not more important, than the tools they use.
